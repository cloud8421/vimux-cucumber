WHAT?
====================

Heavily inspired by [Vimux-ruby-test](https://github.com/pgr0ss/vimux-ruby-test). Most of the codebase is directly taken from that plugin itself.

- Run the feature your cursor is currently on
- Run the entire feature you are working in
- Streaming output to tmux via vimux

HOW?
====================

Use any of the commands below. Map them to shortcuts
in your .vimrc for easy access.

  - RunFocusedCuke - run focused cuke
  - RunAllCukes - run all cukes in the current file

IMPORTANT: if you use this plugin and Vimux-Ruby-Test, you may want to share the same shortcut.
If you do, you can use the following configuration:

    if exists('$TMUX')
      autocmd FileType ruby map <buffer> <Leader>f :RunRubyFocusedTest<CR>
      autocmd FileType ruby map <buffer> <Leader>t :RunAllRubyTests<CR>
      autocmd FileType cucumber map <Leader>f :RunFocusedCuke<CR>
      autocmd FileType cucumber map <Leader>t :RunAllCukes<CR>
    endif

This assumes that your Vim configuration recognizes Cucumber features with the `cucumber` file type.
